        <hr />
        <h3>In Bruges</h3>
            <p>One of the funniest films I've seen. 
                The casting is impeccable and the writing is genius.</p>
        <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
            <p>The greatest superhero film ever made. 
                Christopher Nolan knows exactly how to make a blockbuster. 
                And who can forget Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker? 
                The greatest performance as a villain ever? I think so.</p>
        <h3>The Usual Suspect</h3>
            <p>I can always remember how amazed I was when the twist began to unravel.
                My jaw was on the flaw.
